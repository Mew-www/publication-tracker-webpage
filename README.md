# publi(fi)cation-tracker-webpage - yes there's a typo in repo name
Angular2 harkkatyö / Angular2 school assignment

First time playing around Angular2 using ng-cli, in team of 2.

Functionality of the app in tl;dr:
> Enter search term (movie / serie) in searchbox
> Pick whatever publications
> They're saved in localStorage and you can view them on the other page
Dumb simple features (aside from the Service handling API paging, which is just abstracted away).

APIkey use is per-IP-address so it works for this app (unlike most other APIkeys that require an intermediate server).
